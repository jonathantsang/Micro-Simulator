# crate simulator

# Simple

Plan:
- simple like loading bar simulator, trump game
- lose money and open card packs

hook:
- lack of direction is intriguing for exploration
- opening card packs, lose money

goal:
- lose $1 million dollars
- get pink cards

effort:
- clicking cards
- upgrading stuff

end:
- reaching achievement milestones

game:
start just by opening loot
- similar to the nba2k card pack
- display generic backs, then show colours
- count points

still need:
- open button add score and get rid of cards
- graphic that shows the rarity scale

Dates:
August 14th: 
- Basic concept

August 15th:
- concept

August 16th:
- colours have different spawn rates (common white 30%, brown 20%, etc
.)
- make cards have a points value that is counted up when all 6 have been revealed
- card effects when opened (particle effects)

August 17th:
- card effects when opened (particle effects)

August 18th:
- menu to start game
- exit game gameobject

August 19th:
- inventory to view the cards (figure out if it is persistent)

August 22th:
- four crates per open instead of six
- money counter, sell cards in inventory

August 23st:
- upgrade shop
- button click sound

August 24th:
- steamworks api

extension:
- get opening crates by playing simple games
- get currency to buy loot boxes through simple games (ex. tower defense, rare loot are rare tower type variants)
- Cards have letters (A, B, D) denoting type
- limit at 10 crates every 2 hours, show timer
- saving the game and persistent data
- simplify colours (still deciding on this)

plan:
- simulate opening a card pack/crate
- crates 10 every day
- rarity:
fuzz
turquoise
green
red
purple
blue
brown
white

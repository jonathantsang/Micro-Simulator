# crate simulator

game:
start just by opening loot
- similar to the nba2k card pack
- display generic backs, then show colours
- count points

still need:
- open button add score and get rid of cards
- graphic that shows the rarity scale

Dates:
August 14th: Basic concept

simple.

extension:
- colours have different spawn rates (common white 30%, brown 20%, etc.)
- inventory system
- get currency to buy loot boxes through simple games (ex. tower defense, rare loot are rare tower type variants)

plan:
- simulate opening a card pack/crate
- crates 10 every day
- rarity:

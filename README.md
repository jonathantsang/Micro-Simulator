real extension:
- sparkle sound on rare cards
- move inventory interface to the main screen instead of a new scene

extension:
- get opening crates by playing simple games
- get currency to buy loot boxes through simple games (ex. tower defense, rare loot are rare tower type variants)
- Cards have letters (A, B, D) denoting type
- limit at 10 crates every 2 hours, show timer
- saving the game and persistent data
- simplify colours (still deciding on this)

plan:
- simulate opening a card pack/crate
- crates 10 every day
- rarity:

turquoise
green
red
